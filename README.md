## Installation
We recommend using a Python virtual environment.  
Then install the entire pipeline by running `pip install -e .`.    

## Experiments
The [experiments](experiments) folder contains experiment setups for some common domains.
You can run any of them with `./run.py <domain>:<experiment>`, where domain is the domain name,
and "experiment" a concrete experiment setup for that domain, e.g., `./run.py space_invaders:1`.
